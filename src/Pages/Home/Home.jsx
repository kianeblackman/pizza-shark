              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Welcome to Pizza Shark, where the love for pizza and sharks
                collide! We're Max üßëüèæ‚Äçü¶±, Sam üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶±, and Lucy üë©üèº‚Äçü¶∞, and we're the proud
                owners of this little pizzeria that could.
              </p>
              <p>
                It all started with a crazy idea - what if we combined our love
                for pizza with our fascination for sharks? We know, it sounds a
                bit odd, but stick with us. We found this rundown old building
                in Brighton that used to be a fish and chip shop and it had a
                funny shaped roof that looked like a shark's fin. That's when
                the lightbulb went off - we knew it was meant to be!
              </p>
              <p>
                We spent months renovating the building and turning it into a
                funky pizzeria with a quirky, shark-themed decor. We even got a
                custom-built pizza oven in the shape of a shark's head. It was a
                labor of love, but it was all worth it when we opened our doors
                to the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                We poured our hearts and souls into Pizza Shark, from perfecting
                our dough recipe to creating silly puns for our pizza names. We
                wanted to create a fun and welcoming space where people could
                enjoy great pizza and have a laugh at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fast forward a few years, and we're blown away by how much love
                and support we've received from our community. We've expanded to
                multiple locations in Brighton, but we've never lost sight of
                our roots. We're still just a bunch of pizza-loving friends who
                want to spread joy and laughter with every slice.
              </p>
              <p>
                So come on in, grab a slice, and join us in celebrating the
                magic of pizza and sharks. We promise you won't regret it!
